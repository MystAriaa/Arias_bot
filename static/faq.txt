```Why Arias_bot ?
Due to growing harassment on the Twitch platform, and impunity for toxic online behavior, pooling the efforts of moderation communities will create a slightly healthier space. The original idea came from RebeuDeter. This project started as a way to train me to code, manage a BDD and make requests to APIs. Never finishing my projects, I promise to finish this one.```

```When does the bot apply the banishments on my channel ? 
The bot updates user accounts banned on member channels every day at 5:00 UTC+0.```
```Are all bans shared even timeout/temporary ? 
Every bans are shared if you choose too. By checking the box "timeout" in yout portal page after being connected by Twitch, you will allow timed-out (temporary) bans to be applied on your channel. Unchecking it will not allow them.```
```How does filters options works ?
With the filter options you can choose which users banned in our database will be ban by Arias_bot on your Twitch channel. A checked box means allowed on your channel. "Permanent" refers to any ban made indefinetly. "Timeout" refers to any temporary ban. "Only Commented" refers to any ban with a specific commentary for the original moderation team. "Without comment" refers to any ban without a commentary made by the original moderation team.
Within commented bans, some are filter and put in categories, those are "Sexism"/"Homophobia"/"Rascism"/"Backseat"/"Spam"/"Username"/"Other". At last you are able to filter any ban made by non-affiliated Twitch channels. By checking this box, only bans made from Twitch affiliates and parteners will be applied to your channel.```
```What happens if I missclick a banishment, troll ban, banish an innocent user ? 
Banishments are shared every day at 5am UTC+0. You therefore have a large window of time in case of error of your par.```
```What happens if I unban a user ? 
This user will be unban from the network too at 5 hour UTC+0. However, if this same user has been banned by another member of the network he will remain banned.```
```Do I need to specify the reason for my bans ? 
No, bans are traced and indicated as coming from your channel. However it is always helpfull to add a comment to help our network to filter and your own moderation team.```
```How does "Give-Only" and "Receive-Only" works ?
These two configurations are the opposite of each other. By activating the "Give-Only" option for you channel Arias_bot will no longer be able to ban anybody in our database on your channel. However banned users on your channel will still be gathered and shared. By activating the "Receive-Only" option for you channel Arias_bot be able to ban anybody in our database on your channel. However banned users on your channel will no longer be gathered and shared.```
```How can I trust this third-party application ? 
You canâ€™t completely, Arias_bot is the most transparent project possible. With an open source code, a complete F.A.Q and a Discord server we hope to give you confidence. Any feedbacks are welcomed and there are still room for improvement.```
